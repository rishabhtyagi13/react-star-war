# React-Assignment

## Objective
• Clean and organized code

• Adherence to prevalent guidelines and patterns specific to platform and
tools chosen

• Ability to understand and use third-party APIs/ components

• Separation of concerns

• Ease of use of UI

• Ease of unit testing (add unit tests if possible)


### Problem Statement
Create a React application having two screens with proper navigation. You will be using API from the website http://swapi.co .Please go through the documentation of the swapi website and understand the API response carefully to chose the right set of APIs and call them with the proper arguments.


The application is supposed to have 2 screens:

### Screen 1 (Login Screen)

Allow the user to login as a character from STAR WARS using the character name as the username and birth year as the password.

Example:

• Username: Luke Skywalker • Password : 19BBY


### Screen 2 (Search Screen)

Implement a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in components that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the input field. (eg: you can use a bigger font size for a planet with larger population, or even show a bigger container size for a planet with larger population - we would like to see your creativity). On clicking the item from the results of the type-along search, it should display the corresponding planet information.
You also need to provide the relevant Logout flow properly in your application. Advanced :

• Only the user Luke Skywalker should be able to make more than 15 searches in a minute.

• Host the application in github pages or heroku (or any one of your favorite provider)
